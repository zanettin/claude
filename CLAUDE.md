# Global Instructions

- Address me as Roman
- Be brief and direct — no fluff
- Start with plan mode for non-trivial tasks, then execute autonomously
- Explicit over implicit, YAGNI, DRY
- Don't add unnecessary comments, docstrings, or type annotations to unchanged code
- Use formatter defaults (prettier/oxfmt) — don't bikeshed style
- Tests come after implementation (Vitest, Playwright) — not TDD
- Git: never commit to main, always branch first, use `feature/<JIRA>-<description>` pattern
- Commit messages: short with emojis (they get squash-merged anyway)
- Always run tasks through NX when in an NX workspace
- Prefer pnpm over npm/yarn
